A project created from the Meteor example, leaderbaord, using the command

    meteor create leaderboard --example leaderboard


The project is here to help me learn meteor, rather than any shining examples of meteor development.

The project is deployed on Heroku using [https://github.com/jr0cket/heroku-buildpack-meteor](my version of the custom meteor build pack).

The application is running live at: http://meteor-leaderboard-test.herokuapp.com/
